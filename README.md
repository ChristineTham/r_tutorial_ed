## R Tutorial 

These are the materials used for internal R training at the Wisconsin Department 
of Public Instruction. 

The bootcamp is intended to help non-R users in education policy/research get

collaborate on projects with each other across district and state lines. The topics covered include:

* Setting Up R
* Introduction to R
* Getting Data In
* Sorting and Reshaping Data
* Cleaning Education Data
* Regression and Basic Analytics in R
* Visualizing Data
* Exporting Your Work
* Advanced Topics

Future enhancements include a more in-depth data visualization tutorial, how to 
build presentations and reproducible research, and speaker notes!
